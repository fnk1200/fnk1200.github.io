    <p>Dear Beau, <br>
    First of all there's absolutely no need to apologize for getting back to me late (Clearly I would be a hypocrite to be bothered by that). Hearing from you whenever you are able to reply is good enough. Honey you can write me a novella and I will appreciate it. <br>
    The fact that you started going to the same school as one of your pen pals is crazy to me. Is that just me or is that not much of a big deal? Jacob sounds like me when I was that age. Juliette is an example of what usually happens in life with people after a while.All I can say for my previous pen pals is that they were fictional and always had a dumbass energy about them. I don't know why. I just wrote them that way. <br>
    I'm a quiet person too and have a hard time just jumping into a group conversations. Small talk is just plain painful. 
    You saying that you have a hard time connecting with people and that it gets lonely really resonates with me. I think I am quiet until I become extremely comfortable with a person. And once I am comgortable I joke and goof around a lot. It takes time for me to get comfortable. Unfortunately not everyone has that. <br> 
    I have a hard time being dishonest too. I don't think I would be able to push sales onto people either. Trying to convince someone of something is not a job I can pull off. Some friends have said that I look intimidating or arrogant too. I think looking like that has some advantages. You ward off unwanted attention. I know I've been saying that "I'm like that too" alot but a lot of what you are saying is relatable to me.You mentioned you like to write so what do you write about?  <br> 
    So I'm a fire sign that means that my personality is supposed to be enthusiastic, rebellious, extroverted, passionate, brave and valiant. That sounds great but I don't think necessarily describes me. You now what I just thought of? How these signs could be our bending powers. That means you are an earth bender and I am a fire bender(would have preferred water but this works too). I absolutely love personality quizzes. They definitely are a lot of fun. Pretty sure I have taken every uquiz I came across. I adore them! And when it's accurate its like Damn! didn't know I could be so succinctly described. My Meyers Briggs personality, if I am remebering it correctly, was INFP. That means that I am introverted, idealistic, creative, and driven by high values. This description we can keep. <br>
    I admire that you define yourself as a Romanticist. I keep running from defining myself.This letter itself took me a lot of time to decide the content or the aesthetic. (Also I have a faulty keyboard so it takes a bloody long time to type) I'm more interested by the potentiality of things rather than the actuality of them. That may be one of the most accurate way I can describe myself.  <br>  
    So my music taste is all over the place. I got a huge playlist that has some songs from Hozier, a few from Tracy Chapman, around 2 from Daniel Ceasar, one from Billie Holiday, some from Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and so on and so forth. It's more about what I sound good to my ears than who is singing.I spend a lot of time on youtube, watching Khadija Mbowe, Mooro and 3blue1brown among others. The one movie that I can watch a million times and not get sick of is Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl (the sequels can go to hell). It's an enjoyable film. Sad and depressed? It's a comedic adventure to lift your spirits. Feeling lonely? It's a periodic forbidden romance. Paints EIC (East India Company) as the villain? Yes please (although that is mostly in sequels). I mostly end up watching sitcoms (The Office, The Good Place, 30 rock, Brooklyn 99, basically all of them). TV shows for me are mostly like flavours of the week. I become obssessed with one then binge, rewatch several times and then move on. Currently, I'm obssessed with Insecure and Community right now. Sometimes my friends suggest certain animes but right now I'm watching Neon Genesis Evangalion. Choosing a favourite book is like choosing a favourite child, doesn't seem fair. Nostalgia is a big factor for me on these so probably Harry Potter (Fuck JKR and her politics though) and The Hunger Games can be considered my favourite even though I haven't read them in a while. I still haven't been able to recreate that feeling I had when I read then for the first time. I'll tell you about the books I'm currently reading, one is called Women of Sufism and the second is called Tehri Lakeer (which translates to crooked line). Women of Sufism is about mystic women and their contribution to sufism. These women are <i>wise</i> and that is not a word we use to describe people much. I use smart, intelligent or even genius but a wise person is rare for me to come by. Do you know anyone that you might consider wise? The thing that I like about the second book is the way it is written. The prose make me go crazy. I never even imagined that it was possible to write in Urdu like that.  <br>                         

    Can I just say I am so proud of you for making it to the other side and your growth. Two take aways from your story; sometimes people who love us know us better than we know ourselves and that sometimes the people who have the hardest time accepting us is ourselves. And you are right Julia is going to be okay, for one she has you to be there for her. <br>

    I just noticed that all of the names in your letter start with a J lol. I don't know why I found that coincidence a bit funny. Last question, what's something you found funny recently? The world seems awful right now. Could do with a little laugh.<br>
    
    I hope you have as much fun reading my letters as I do yours. Hope to hear back soon from you.<br>

    Take care and stay safe,<br>
    Fae<br>
